## Musical landscape of Switzerland

For our project, we want to look into the cultural aspects of Swizerland, more specifically its musical life. We will gather informations from the web about concerts happening throughout the country and the artists related, and try to get useful insights out of it, which has been little done here so far according to our sources.


Our first task will be to survey the data available, and which we can gather without spending our days and nights trying to process it. To this purpose, we will look into mainsteams platforms of today and before, such as lastfm or bandsintown, as well as Swiss ticketsale platforms and online cultural agendas. Data wrangling will most probably be one of the main challenge of this project, given we won't be able to work solely through a well furnished API such as Twitter's or Amazon's, although would we be optimistic, we will be able to get and process the data early enough to raise and answer interesting questions about it.
